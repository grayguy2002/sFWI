# **sFWI: Physics-Informed Score-Based Generative Modelling for Robust Full Waveform Inversion**

Welcome to the **sFWI** repository! This project introduces a novel approach to Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) using **Physics-Informed Score-Based Generative Modelling**. Our method leverages the power of generative models to enhance the robustness and accuracy of FWI, addressing challenges in geophysical exploration and imaging.
